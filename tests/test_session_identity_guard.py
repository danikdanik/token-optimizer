"""A nudge must never report another session's numbers as yours.

Observed failure: a verbosity-steer nudge fired on the FIRST prompt of a
brand-new session, quoting fill 47% / score 73. That session's transcript was
essentially empty and could not have produced those figures. The nudge reads a
quality cache keyed by the resolved transcript, and when no transcript_path was
supplied it fell back to _find_current_session_jsonl() -- which returns the most
recently active transcript, i.e. somebody else's on a new session. Nothing
checked that the resolved transcript was the live one.

The blast radius is not a cosmetic wrong number: the nudge is persuasive, and an
assistant acting on it conserves tokens that were never scarce for the rest of
the session.

Silence is the correct failure mode here. A missing nudge costs a small
optimization; a wrong nudge costs the whole session.
