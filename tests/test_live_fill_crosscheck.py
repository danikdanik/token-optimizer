"""When the host's fill figure disagrees with ours, our window is wrong.

live-fill.json carries used_percentage supplied by Claude Code itself, already
gated on freshness and session match. When that gate passes, the host figure
wins -- which is correct, since the host knows the real window and we only infer
it.

The subtle part: that rescue makes a misconfiguration invisible. The user sees a
correct percentage, so nothing looks broken, while the inferred window stays
wrong for every other consumer (the dashboard, trends, the savings estimate).
Recording the disagreement is what turns a silent save into a signal.

This layer is a corroborator, not a primary source. When live-fill.json is
stale, missing, or from another session it says nothing, and the disclosure and
contradiction guards still stand on their own.
